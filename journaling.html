        <h2>October 13, 2025</h2>
        <p>I'm reading about decolonization written by Christian Ortiz. Here is part of what he wrote:</p>
        <q>In pre-Christian Europe, people lived in close rhythm with the land. Communities celebrated the harvest not just to mark abundance, but to honor the living systems that made life possible. The festivals were acts of relationship, not transactions. People offered thanks to rivers for water, to the sun for warmth, to the soil for fertility, and to ancestors for guidance. Gratitude was a conversation between humans and the natural world. It was a practice of humility, rooted in the understanding that life depends on balance, not control.</q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <q>Then came a transformation that would change the meaning of gratitude for centuries. As Christianity spread across Europe, the Church absorbed and reinterpreted older earth-based traditions. The seasonal festivals were not eliminated outright, but they were rebranded. The Church began declaring official Days of Thanksgiving and Days of Fasting to mark divine mercy or favor. Gratitude was redirected upward, toward a single God, rather than outward, toward the living world.</q>    
        <br>
        <br>
        <q>This shift was profound. It replaced reciprocity with hierarchy. Instead of giving thanks through relationship with the Earth, people were now expected to express gratitude through obedience to divine authority. To be thankful meant to submit, not to participate. The Earth was no longer sacred in itself; it was a resource created for human use.</q>    
        <br>
        <br>
        <q>For racialized, disabled, queer, and Indigenous people, this culture of gratitude can feel suffocating. Gratitude is not an option; it is an expectation. To speak up about injustice risks being labeled ungrateful or angry. To ask for systemic change is to threaten the delicate illusion of harmony. Institutions reward those who conform to gratitude and quietly punish those who do not.</q>>
        <br>
        <br>
        <q>Over time, people learn to internalize this control. They perform gratitude not because they feel it, but because they know it is safer. Gratitude becomes a performance of emotional intelligence that hides exhaustion, grief, or anger. It is praised as professionalism, but it is often survival.</q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <q>This is what happens when systems confuse visibility with transformation. A company can feature diverse faces in its campaigns, a university can showcase multicultural events, and a government can release statements of reconciliation, all while the underlying structures remain unchanged. Gratitude becomes the emotional shield that protects the status quo.</q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <q>Thanksgiving operates in the same way at a national level. It invites the country to be grateful for prosperity without asking who paid for it. It encourages unity without addressing the wounds that unity conceals. It rewards those who participate in the ritual and isolates those who refuse.</q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <q>Thanksgiving, in its decolonized form, is not a day of comfort. It is a day of accountability. It is a moment to honor what endures and to mourn what has been lost. It is an opportunity to practice a deeper kind of gratitude, one that does not end at the table but begins there.</q>
       
        <p>I'm going to suggest to our family that we celebrate the earth and God's creation instead of the traditional Thanksgiveing from now on. But even larger than this discussion of Thanksgiving, becoming enlighted about socialization - which is just a whitewashing of all minds that white people deserve the best and it's OK if they take from others to have the best - is my complete questioning and rejecting of white society.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>October 15, 2025</h2>
        <p>I have been getting Sharon Hurley's Anti-racism newsletter for the last three months. I was looking through an email that she had written in which she asked where I was in my ani-racism journey. I wrote her back and here is what I wrote:</p>
        <br>
        <p>Hi Sharon,<br>
        <br>

        I apologize for taking so long to get back to you to address this question that you asked me. <br>
        <br>

        I recently retired from a corporate American job that some would have said that I stayed too long at in the first place. But I want to answer your question by stating my overall journey and the reasons behind my anti-racism stands at the time. <br>
        <br>

        The first reason is that more than ten-years ago, even before I considered myself an anti-racist, I observed that organizations were pretty much the same on how they treated Black people in workplaces. I had worked at two organizations before the one I was currently working, and I saw the same practices at all three organizations.<br>
        <br>

        The other reasons are that the company offered a 401K plan and a pension plan, something that most companies are no longer offering their employees. I had also built a reputation at the company that had earned me several promotions. So, I didn't want to start all over again at another company proving myself again to strangers.<br>
        <br>

        So, my journey as an anti-racist up to this point was to impact the environment where I was at the same time that I looked out for my best interest. Since I had built trust, and a history with people who have been mostly White during my entire career, it was easier to have tough conversations that challenged their bias ways of thinking and acting. I never backed out of difficult conversations, and I always looked for ways to have an impact. <br>
        <br>

        However, my views on anti-racism have evolved as I grew older. My quest in getting a Sociology degree revealed to me how broad racism is. It's in everything! The environment, banking, housing, health, the law, history, politics, and opportunities. And, with the political climate what it is in America now, it caused my anti-racism journey to evolve even more. I feel we are going backwards or not making enough of an impact to make real differences. As I became more enlightened, I began to shift my focus.<br>
        <br>

        I'm no longer convinced that the way to be an anti-racist is to work with White people. In fact, I'm beginning to think that all initiatives by White people, such as DEI initiatives, are just another way to control people. White people are still the ones making the decisions. They are also the ones who can take everything away at a whim, as we are now seeing, particularly in American politics. <br> 
        <br>

        So, my anti-racism journey has switched from trying to work with White people to trying to empower Black people, especially Black woman. I had used the 401K and pension plans to my advantage and had been diligent about my finances throughout the years. So, I was in the position to retire early. Me staying all those years in what I now see was a hostile and toxic environment paid off in the end for me.<br>
        <br>

        Now I can be more intentional about my anti-racism journey. I don't know how it's going to show up. I want to take some time to determine that. But I can say my anti-racism journey at this time is to find ways to empower Black people to be able to control their destinies better than too many of us can do now. However, I am always staying open and hope that my views will continue to evolve as the battle continues.<br>
        <br>

        I hope I have answered your question and I thank you for asking.<br>
        <br>

        I look forward to continuing to work with people like you in our anti-racism journey.<br>
        <br>

        Kind regards,<br>
        <br>

        Paulette</p>
    
    <h2>October 21, 2025</h2>
    <p>I would love to be able to write daily. But I don't think that I will put that burden on myself. Sometimes I feel more inspired than other times. Sometimes time doesn't permit. I've tried writing daily in the past and it has always eventually become a burden. So, I will simply try to write on a regular basis. On the days that I do write, I'm going to try to include a quote that inspired me to write that day. On this day, I have a carousel of inspiring thoughts. The background of the quotes are light. So, it's difficult to see that you can click through three different quotes that I added. But click on the left or right edges of the image or use the bottom carousel buttons to click through the quotes.</p>
