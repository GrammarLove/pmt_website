        <p>On this page of my website, I will cover grammar concepts.</p>
        <p>Grammar concepts are important for various reasons. My reasons for creating this page is not only for it to be a handy resource for myself, but also for others. Also, now that I'm learning foreign languages, I find it necesary to understand what is meant by the subjective, imperative, perfect, etc, forms of verbs.</p>
        <p>I also want a quick references for confusing words like homophones and words that are easily confused, such as affect and effect.</p>
        <p>So, to that end, the page begins.</p>

  <h2>Perfect Subjective</h2>
    <p>The perfect subjective verb form is a grammatical term that indicates that an action or circumstance occurred earlier than the time under consideration, often focusing on the resulting state rather than the occurrence itself. In English, the perfect tense is formed using the auxiliary verb "have" or "has" together with the past participle of the main verb. For example, "I have finished my homework" indicates that the action of finishing homework occurred before the time of speaking. The perfect tense is used to express completed actions or states, and it can be contrasted with other tenses such as the imperfect, which refers to past actions or states that are not completed.</p>

    <div class="cell">They will have been</div>
 </div>

 <h2>Informal Future</h2>
    <p>The informal future verb form, often referred to as the periphrastic future, is formed using the verb "To go" conjugated in the present tense. For example, "I will go." This form is commonly used in informal contexts to express future intentions or plans. Unlike the formal future tense, which typically uses "will," the informal future is more casual and often lacks the formal structure of auxiliary verbs.</p>
